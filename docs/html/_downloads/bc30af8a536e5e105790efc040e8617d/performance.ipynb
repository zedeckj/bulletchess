        "\n# Performance Comparisons\n\n``bulletchess``'s creation was motivated by my frustration with [python-chess](https://python-chess.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)'s slow performance, especially for areas such as machine learning and engine development. \n``python-chess`` is a fantastic, feature-rich library, but is inherently limited in its speed by being implemented in python. ``bulletchess``, however, is implemented as a pure C-extension, \nallowing it to be significantly faster. To demonstrate this, we can write equivalent functions in both libraries, and compare the runtimes.\n\n\n<div class=\"alert alert-info\"><h4>Note</h4><p>``bulletchess`` is neither an extension nor a port of ``python-chess``, and has a distinct and independent implementation.</p></div>\n\nLet's start by implementing a [Perft](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Perft) function. In ``bulletchess``:\n"
