Basic Walkthrough

First, lets import everything from ``bulletchess``

# The :func:`Board()` constructor returns a :class:`Board` representing the starting position.
# 

board = Board()
board

# %%
# The :class:`Board` class defines :func:`Board._repr_html_()`, which allows positions to be rendered
# like the above in Jupyter note books, or Sphinx documentation like this page.
# For displaying a :class:`Board` as plain text, we use :func:`Board.__str__()`.

print(str(board))

# %% 
# Other positions can be specified by either using :func:`Board.from_fen()`,

board = Board.from_fen("rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2")

# %%
# Or by assigning :class:`Piece` locations manually. We can use :func:`Board.empty()` to start from a clean slate.

board = Board.empty()
board

# %%
# And then assign a :class:`Piece` to each :class:`Square`.
#

board[G2] = Piece(WHITE, KING)
board[F2] = Piece(WHITE, PAWN)
board[G3] = Piece(WHITE, PAWN)

# %%
# We can get the FEN of this position with :func:`Board.fen()`. We might want to set the half-move clock
# and full-move number for this endgame position. Let's also make it black's turn.

board.halfmove_clock = 3
board.fullmove_number = 43
board.turn = BLACK

board.fen()

# %%
# Indexing a :class:`Board` with a :class:`Color`, :class:`PieceType`, or both returns :class:`Bitboard` 
# of squares with the relevant pieces. A :class:`Bitboard` is simply an efficient representation 
# of a set of squares.

print(board[WHITE])

print(board[BLACK, PAWN])

# %%
# We can generate legal :class:`Move` objects for this position with :func:`Board.legal_moves()`

# Let's move our rook. To perform a move, we use :func:`Board.apply()`. 
# Moves can be created manually with the :func:`Move()` constructor.

board.apply(selected_move)
board


# %% 
# Oh, but that was a blunder. Moves can be undone with :func:`Board.undo()`, which returns
# the last :class:`Move` applied. Getting the ``str`` of a :class:`Move` renders the move
# in UCI long algebraic notation.

print("Undoing " + str(board.undo()))
board


# %% 
# Let's run the game through for a bit. Moves can also be constructed from UCI or standard algebraic notation.
